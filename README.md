# MMCS Consultancy Project 
### Erin Fortin, Alice Locker, Katheryne Davis, Angel Ezeokoli
The Jupyter notebook `Group30Model.ipynb` contains the optimisation preparation, modelling, and outcome evaluation for the consultancy project part of the 2025/26 Methodology, Modelling, and Consulting Skills course at the University of Edinburgh.

This project was carried out by our team with guidance from our instructor, Dr. Kit Searle, and our Sopra Steria point of contact, Kal Bukovski.

## Important Note
As GitHub limits the size of imported files, we must work under the assumption that the user of our code has access to the following files: `edinburgh_pois.csv`,  `counts-data.zip`, `cyclehire-data.zip`, and `station_data.csv`. While not all of these files are directly used in our code, they offer insight into the context of the project as presented by Kit and Kal.
